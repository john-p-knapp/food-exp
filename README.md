Recipe MD is a a two part experiment. The first, and more important, part is capturing some of our favorite recipes in a simple markdown format that is easy to edit and post online. Our recipe collection is located in the top level recipe folder.

The second part is developing a simple recipe specific grammar which we can use to recreate recipes in multiple formats from formal structure. The initial version of this grammar is located in ./src/main/antlr4/recipemd and the existing sample written in that format are located in ./src/main/resources/recipe_files
