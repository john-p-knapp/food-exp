2. Olives, here big fleshy green Ascolanes from Italy, and fennel are an extraordinary pairing with chicken. In this one-pot dish, we use only the thighs, the most flavorful part of the chicken. 
3. The seared chicken is braised in chicken stock on a bed of fennel, onion, and garlic, with strips of lemon zest. The stock picks up the lemon and fennel flavors and becomes concentrated and rich. Here the flavors are Mediterranean, but the technique itself can be taken in any number of seasoning directions. 
4. Cut off the fennel stalks. Trim the bottom of the bulbs and peel back the Layers until you reach the core; reserve the core for another use. Discard any bruised layers, and cut the fennel into 2-by-1/2-inch batons. You need 3 cups fennel for this recipe; reserve any remaining fennel for another use. 
5. Preheat the oven to 375F. Set a cooling rack on a baking sheet.

8. Taste the stock and season with salt as needed. Return the chicken to the pan skin-side-up, in a single layer. When the liquid returns to a simmer, transfer to the oven and cook for about 20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. 
9. Turn on the broiler, and put the pan under the broiler for a minute or two to crisp and brown the chicken skin. Remove from the oven, and transfer to a serving platter. Garnish with the parsley leaves.
