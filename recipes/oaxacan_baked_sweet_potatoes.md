### Directions: 
1. Preheat the oven to 400F 
2. Wash, dry, and poke holes into **4 sweet potatoes** . Place on a parchment-lined sheet pan and bake on the middle rack until tender in the center when you pierce with a fork. 

#### Quick Mole Sauce
3. Combine in a blender: **15 oz crushed tomatos** , **4 cloves garlic** , **1/2 onion rough diced** , **1/2 cup water** , **1 tbl soy sauce** , **1 chipotle chili** , **1 tbl adobo sauce** , **2 tsp chili powder** , **2 tsp cumin** , **2 tsp coriander** , **1/2 tsp pepper** , **1/2 tsp salt** . Blend until smooth. 
4. Place this Mole sauce in a medium pot, bring it to a simmer over medium-low heat, cover and cook over medium-low heat. 
5. Cook until flavors meld and the onion is tempered. 
6. Stir in **4 tbl tahini paste** and **2 oz dark chocolate squares** stir until melted and combined. Taste, adjust salt and sweetness. Turn heat off and set aside. 



#### Filling
7. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute the **1/2 onion diced** until starting to soften. 
8. Lower heat to medium and add **1 red bell pepper , diced small** , **1 cup zucchini diced small** , **4 cloves garlic minced** , **1/2 tsp salt** , and cook until tender. 
9. Add the **1 cup corn** , heat through. Set aside. 
10. When the sweet potatoes are tender and cool enough to handle, using a knife, split lengthwise, careful to not go all the way through. Push the two pointy ends together like you would a coin purse, revealing the fleshy insides. Using a spoon, scoop out about a half of a cup, out of each sweet potato and place this in a medium bowl. You should have roughly 2 cups or a bit more. Add the cooked veggies and mix. 
11. Add **1/2 tsp cumin** , **1/2 tsp coriander** , **1/2 tsp chipotle powder** , **1 cup Mexican cheese** , **2 cup Mole Sauce** 
12. Spoon the filling back into the sweet potatoes, mounding them up a bit. Brush skins with a little olive oil. 
13. Reduce heat to 375F until warmed through, 25 minutes. 
14. Garnish with **1/4 cup chopped cilantro** and **2 tbl pumpkin seeds**
