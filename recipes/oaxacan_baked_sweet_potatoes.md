#### Filling {
1. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute the **1/2 onion diced** until starting to soften. 
2. Lower heat to medium and add **1 red bell pepper , diced small** , **1 cup zucchini diced small** , **4 cloves garlic minced** , **1/2 tsp salt** , and cook until tender. 
3. Add the **1 cup corn** , heat through. Set aside. 
4. When the sweet potatoes are tender and cool enough to handle, using a knife, split lengthwise, careful to not go all the way through. Push the two pointy ends together like you would a coin purse, revealing the fleshy insides. Using a spoon, scoop out about a half of a cup, out of each sweet potato and place this in a medium bowl. You should have roughly 2 cups or a bit more. Add the cooked veggies and mix. 
5. Add **1/2 tsp cumin** , **1/2 tsp coriander** , **1/2 tsp chipotle powder** , **1 cup Mexican cheese** , **2 cup Mole Sauce** 
6. Spoon the filling back into the sweet potatoes, mounding them up a bit. Brush skins with a little olive oil. 
7. Reduce heat to 375F until warmed through, 25 minutes. 
8. Garnish with **1/4 cup chopped cilantro** and **2 tbl pumpkin seeds**
