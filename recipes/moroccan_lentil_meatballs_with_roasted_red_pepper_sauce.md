#### Lentil Meatballs {
2. In a small pot combine **1/2 cup red lentils** and **1.5 cup water** . Bring to a boil simmer 6 minutes. Drain. 
3. In the bowl of a food processor, combine:  
**1.5 cup cooked lentils**   
**3/4 cup breadcrumbs**   
**1/2 cup roughly chopped red onion**

4. Pulse, mixing until combined, but not pureed, leaving a little texture. (The texture should be similar to dough. If it feels too wet to roll, mix in extra breadcrumbs.) 
5. Use a medium cookie dough scoop to scoop out tablespoon amounts of lentil meatball mixture and roll into 18 balls. Place on a lined baking sheet. 
6. Bake for 20 minutes until lightly browned.
