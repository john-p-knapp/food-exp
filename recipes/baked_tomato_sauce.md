# Baked Tomato Sauce 

### Ingredients: 
* 112 oz whole peeled tomatoes
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 4 tbl butter
* 8 cloves garlic
* 1 tsp red pepper flakes
* 1 tbl dried oregano
* 1 carrot
* 1 onion
* 1/4 cup basil
* 1 tbl fish sauce
* 1/2 cup basil

### Directions: 
1. Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 300F (165C). 
2. Place **112 oz whole peeled tomatoes** in a large bowl. Using your hands, crush the tomatoes by squeezing them in your fingers until pieces no larger than 1/2-inch remain. Transfer 3 cups of crushed tomatoes to a sealed container and reserve in the refrigerator. 
3. Heat **1/4 cup olive oil** and **4 tbl butter** over medium heat in a large Dutch oven until butter is melted. Add **8 cloves garlic** , minced and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes. 
4. Add **1 tsp red pepper flakes** and **1 tbl dried oregano** and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
5. Add tomatoes, **1 carrot** cut into large chunks, **1 onion** split in half, and **1/4 cup basil** . Stir to combine. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over high heat. 
6. Cover Dutch oven with lid slightly ajar and transfer to oven. Cook, stirring once every 1 to 2 hours, until reduced by about half and darkened to a deep red, 5 to 6 hours (reduce oven temperature if the sauce is bubbling too rapidly or the browned bits begin to turn too dark). 
7. Remove from oven. Using tongs, discard onion halves, carrots, and basil stems. 
8. Add reserved tomatoes to sauce and stir to combine. Add **1 tbl fish sauce** , if using. Season generously with salt and pepper and stir in **1/2 cup basil** , minced along with additional olive oil as desired.
