### Ingredients: 
* 2 tbl olive oil
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 tsp coriander
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp cayenne
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* 5 cup vegetable
* 4 carrots
* 2.5 cup eggplant
* 2.5 cup zucchini
* 2 cup cauliflower florets
* 1 cup onion
* 29 oz stewed tomatoes
* 15 oz chickpeas beans
* 3/4 cup dried currants
* 1 cup toasted almonds
* 1/2 tbl kosher salt

### Directions: 
1. Pour **2 tbl olive oil** into a small frying pan over medium-low heat. Add **3 cloves garlic** crushed, **1 tsp coriander** , **1 tsp cumin** , **1/2 tsp cayenne** , **1/4 tsp cinnamon** . Cook, stirring often until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes, being careful not to scorch the garlic. Scrape the mixture into a slow-cooker (at least 5 qt.). 
2. Add **5 cup vegetable** , **4 carrots** peeled and cut into 1/2-inch lengths, **2.5 cup peeled eggplant** diced, **2.5 cup zucchini** sliced, **2 cup cauliflower florets** , **1 cup onion** diced, **29 oz stewed tomatoes** , **15 oz chickpeas beans** , **3/4 cup dried currants** , **1 cup toasted almonds** chopped, and **1/2 tbl kosher salt** . Stir to combine. 
3. Cover slow-cooker and cook on high until vegetables are tender to bite and flavors are blended, 4 hours. 
4. Ladle about 3 cups of the vegetable mixture into a blender. Holding lid down with a towel and taking care to avoid steam, whirl until smooth. Return puree to slow-cooker and stir to blend. Ladle stew into a tureen or individual bowls.
