# Moroccan Lentil Meatballs with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce 

### Ingredients: 
* 1.5 cup cooked lentils
* 3/4 cup breadcrumbs
* 1/2 cup roughly chopped red onion
* 1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves
* 1 egg
* 2 tbl tomato paste
* 1 tsp soy sauce
* 1/2 tbl garlic
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 12 oz jarred roasted red peppers
* 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 2 tbl harissa (I use Mina brand)
* 1/2 tbl minced fresh garlic
* 1/2 tsp each kosher salt and black pepper

### Directions: 
#### Lentil Meatballs
1. Preheat oven to 350F. 
2. In the bowl of a food processor, combine: **1.5 cup cooked lentils** , **3/4 cup breadcrumbs** , **1/2 cup roughly chopped red onion** , **1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves** , **1 egg** , **2 tbl tomato paste** , **1 tsp soy sauce** , **1/2 tbl minced garlic** , **1 tsp dried oregano** , **1 tsp smoked paprika** , **1/2 tsp salt** , **1/2 tsp black pepper** . 
3. Pulse, mixing until combined, but not pureed, leaving a little texture. (The texture should be similar to dough. If it feels too wet to roll, mix in extra breadcrumbs.) Transfer mixture to a bowl and wipe the food processor clean. 
4. Use a medium cookie dough scoop to scoop out tablespoon amounts of lentil meatball mixture and roll into 18 balls. Place on a lined baking sheet. 
5. Bake for 20 minutes until lightly browned. 


#### Roasted Red Pepper Sauce
6. Combine and puree until smooth: **12 oz jarred roasted red peppers** , **1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil** , **2 tbl harissa (I use Mina brand)** , **1/2 tbl minced fresh garlic** , **1/2 tsp each kosher salt and black pepper** . 


7. Serve **Lentil Meatballs** with **Roasted Red Pepper Sauce** . Garnish with fresh chopped parsley, if desired.
