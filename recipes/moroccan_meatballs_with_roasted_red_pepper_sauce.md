### Ingredients: 
* 1.5 cup cooked lentils
* 3/4 cup breadcrumbs
* 1/2 cup red onion
* 1/4 cup parsley
* 1 egg
* 2 tbl tomato paste
* 1 tsp soy sauce
* 1/2 tbl garlic
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 12 oz roasted red peppers
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 2 tbl harissa
* 1/2 tbl garlic
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper

### Directions: 

#### Lentil Meatballs {
1. Preheat oven to 350F. 
2. In the bowl of a food processor, combine: **1.5 cup cooked lentils** , **3/4 cup breadcrumbs** , **1/2 cup roughly chopped red onion** , **1/4 cup parsley** , **1 egg** , **2 tbl tomato paste** , **1 tsp soy sauce** , **1/2 tbl minced garlic** , **1 tsp dried oregano** , **1 tsp smoked paprika** , **1/2 tsp salt** , **1/2 tsp black pepper** . 
3. Pulse, mixing until combined, but not pureed, leaving a little texture. (The texture should be similar to dough. If it feels too wet to roll, mix in extra breadcrumbs.) Transfer mixture to a bowl and wipe the food processor clean. 
4. Use a medium cookie dough scoop to scoop out tablespoon amounts of lentil meatball mixture and roll into 18 balls. Place on a lined baking sheet. 
5. Bake for 20 minutes until lightly browned.
