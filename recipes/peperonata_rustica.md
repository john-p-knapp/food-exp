# peperonata rustica 

* The roasted peppers in this dish-red, yellow, and smoky piquillos-are torn by hand, not sliced, for a more rustic appearance, then stewed with soffritto, which makes the flavor very deep and sweet (this can be done a day ahead). They are seasoned with Espelette powder, another distinctive pepper flavor. 
### Ingredients: 
*  soffritto
* 6 red bell peppers
* 6 yellow bell peppers
*  oil
*  salt
*  pepper
* 8 oz piquillo peppers
* 1/2 cup soffritto
* 4/3 cup chicken stock
* 3/4 tsp piment d'Espelette

### Directions: 
1. Make **soffritto** 
2. Preheat the oven to 375F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. 
3. Cut the **6 red bell peppers** and **6 yellow bell peppers** lengthwise in half and remove the stems and seeds. 
4. Toss the peppers with **oil** to coat and **salt** and **pepper** to taste. 
5. Arrange the peppers cut side down on the baking sheets, the red peppers on one, the yellow peppers on the other. 
6. Roast the peppers until the skin is blistering, 30 to 35 minutes for the red and 35 to 40 minutes for the yellow; do not allow the edges to blacken. 
7. Transfer the peppers to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap, or put in an airtight container with a lid. 
8. When the peppers are cool enough to handle, peel them. Tear them lengthwise into strips about 3/4 inch wide. 
9. Tear **8 oz piquillo peppers** into strips in the same way. 
10. Combine all of the peppers, the **1/2 cup soffritto** , **4/3 cup chicken stock** , and **3/4 tsp piment d'Espelette** in a medium saucepan over medium heat, season with salt and pepper, and bring to a simmer. 
11. Cook for 30 minutes, to soften the peppers completely and meld the flavors.
